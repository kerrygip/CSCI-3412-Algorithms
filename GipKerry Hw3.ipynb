    "\n",
    ">Although merge sort runs in O(nlogn) worst case time and insertion sorts runs O(n^2) worst case time, the constant factors in insertion sort can make it faster in practice for small problems sizes on many machines. Thus, it makes sense to coarsen the leaves of recurison by using insertion sort within merge sort when subproblems become sufficiently small. Consider a modification to merge sort in which m/k sublists of length k are sorted using insertion sort and then merged using the standard merging mechanism, where k is a value to be determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Show that insertion sort can sort the nk/ sublists of each length k, in O(nk) worst case time\n",
    "    - Assuming that we have n/k sublists and O(k^2) is the worst case running time\n",
    "    - T(n) = (n/k) * O(k^2)  = O(nk)  \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Show how to merge the sublists in O(nlog(n/k)) worst case time  \n",
    "    - The height of the tree in a recursive tree method will be log(n/k) at each level of the tree and the complexity of merging is O(n). As it is merging the sublists, we won't be able to tell the difference between that and the regular merge sort equation. We need n comparisions to merge it back into the list sooo \n",
    "    - n * log(n/k) = nlog(n/k)  \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Given that the modified algorithm runs in O(nk+ nlog(n/k) worst case time, what is the largest value of k as a function of n for which the modified algorithm has the same running time as standard merge sort, in terms of O notation?\n",
    "    - The first half of the equation, nk has the worst running time on its own. k has to be less than O(logn), so that way the k value is almost neglible in the log(n/k). So largest value that k can be is logn.\n",
    "    - c1 * nlogn > c2 * nlog(logn) is only true for n>1. Since the largest function is nlogn, k has to be logn and the time complexity is nlogn\n",
