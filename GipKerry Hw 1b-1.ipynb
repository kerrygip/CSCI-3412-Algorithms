    "A higher order function either takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result to the caller\n",
    "A functor is constantly mistaken for a higher order function and vice versa. A functor is mapping between category theories.\n",
    "[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/functors-in-cpp/] \n",
    "Functors can also be objects that can be treated as though they are a function or function pointer. \n",

    "Inner functions can also protect functions from everything outside, like encapsulation and is really userful for closures\n",

    "[Better encapsulation in python][https://medium.com/better-programming/encapsulation-in-python-d76212d52478]\n",
    "Python has a weak encapsulation because everything is inherently public. Weak encapsulation means that it is performed by convention and not due to the language itself. However with inner functions and decorators, it can help wrap functions within a function and can protect the function from outside variables/functions. \n",
