------EXERCISES----------

1.1-1
Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.

The contact book in our phones needs to be sorted alphabetically so that we can find person phone number easily. 
Some other examples are flights, movie tickets they are all sorted by time. Even our daily schedules are sorted by time.

Convex hull can be defined as a step of points, a line connecting the points in a convex polygonic way, so that all the points are inside it.
- Finding the best price to sell a home (OREGON ML Example)

1.1-2
Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world
setting?
time

1.1-3
Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and
limitations.
queues - first in first out
stacks - first in last out 

1.1-4
How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar?
How are they different?
Same -need an algorithm
Difference - no efficient algorithm 

1.1-5
Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then
come up with one in which a solution that is “approximately” the best is good
enough.
- Best - movie ticket line
- Approximately - printer queue (no difference between large printing stack and just one page)
